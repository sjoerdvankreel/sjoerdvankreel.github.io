<h1>Some layout ideas for infernal synth</h1>
As it stands, the thing's got about 1600 automatable parameters.
Just some rough ideas about how to group them while not "hiding" stuff too much.<p/>
Here's some changes I want to do in any case:<br/>
- move knob labels to small-scale font below the knobs<br/>
- built-in way to access context menu as this appears to not work everywhere (studio one)<br/>
- move most important controls (given a finished patch) to the top (master gain, master cv controls)<br/>
- split voice/global to separate tabs (bonus points: this allows to completely drop voice tab for FX-only mode)<br/>
- drop text-edit for each knob, replace by single last-edited textbox + possibly right-click-knob for exact-editing<br/>
- switch to more opaque background, reduce the use of bg images, differentiate module types by background color (e.g. audio/cv)<br/><p/>
Also some ideas about how to drop parameters altogether (always preferred, of course):<br/>
- Drop stuff that's of no use at all. Example: oscillator gain. Completely covered by audio a gain. It's only there in the current version because otherwise there'd be an empty cell.<br/>
- Merge stuff without giving up too much functionality. Example: merge envelope attack1/slope1/split/attack2/slope2 into attack/split-time/split-level/slope, on the assumption that everyone wants "smooth" envelopes.<br/>
- Merge comboboxes such as "osc/basic/sine, osc/basic/saw, osc/dsf, osc/noise" into "osc/basic-sine, osc/basic-saw, osc/dsf, osc/noise". Same goes for fx, "filter-comb, filter-state-var, delay-feedback, delay-multitap" etc.<br/><p/>
Note, in each example below I have tried to get close to the actual knob-count for each module. So if it looks crowded in the prototype, it will look crowded in the actual version.
<h2>Option #0: as-is</h2>
Implement everything mentioned above except for separate tabs.<br/>
Pros:     <br/>
- easy access to everything<br/>
Cons:<br/>
- doesnt free up enough screen space to comfortably operate knobs by mouse<br/>
Not really on the table, just here for completeness.<br/>

<h2>Option #4: tabbed layout + move matrix (cv a/b, audio a/b)</h2>
